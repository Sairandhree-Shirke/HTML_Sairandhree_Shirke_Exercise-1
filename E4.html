<p><i>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems.</i></p> 
<p><b>You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) n a language computers can understand </b></p>
<p><font face="cascadia code">As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[3][4] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[5][6] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.</font></p>
<p><font face=bookman old style">Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used for this larger overall process – with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se.</font></p>
<p><font face=arial narrow> Sometimes software development is known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process</font></p>.
